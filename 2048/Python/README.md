Play game 2048 with an "artificial intelligence"

IA created :
- Random move. Average score : ~200 pts
- Maximize score at next move. Average score : ~500 pts
- Monte carlo simulations. With 1000 simulation, deep 6 : 32748 pts

Next steps :
- Use C++ / Cython to accelelerate MC simulations
- Parallelize MC simulations
- Use bandit algorithms for MC simulations : UCB, UCT
- Machine learning
- Reinforcement learning : temporal differences learning
